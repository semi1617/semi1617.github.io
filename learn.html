      <p class="learnintro">The United States of America is a country with the highest amount of gun violence deaths per year, second only to Brazil. This overwhelming amount of violence has been on the rise in recent years and has often used other important topics such as mental illness to be the scapegoat for these alarming rates.</p> 
      <p class="learnintro">Nevertheless, gun violence is an epidemic in the United States, one that seeps into every state affecting millions of lives young and old. Advocates continue to bring attention to the dangers of these relentless rates which must be addressed quickly to break the cycle of never ending violence in our communities.</p>

      <h2 class="mentalhealthtitle">Mental Health Misconceptions</h2>
      <p class="mentalhealth">For years, the media has been quick to target mental illness as the primary cause of this rampant trend of gun violence especially after moments of extreme violence such as mass shootings. Although some acts of interpersonal gun violence are committed by those with mental illnesses, the number is extremely small—four percent.</p> 
      <p class="mentalhealth">This misconception increases the stigma against those with mental illness who are more likely to be victims of gun violence than perpetrators. Even those who commit suicide with firearms aren’t all diagnosed of mental illness, less than 50%. As a result, it’s important to avoid approaching gun prevention policy through solely a mental health lens. Alternatively, focusing on helping those with a prior history of violence is more impactful on prevention.</p>
      <h2 class="causetitle">The Real Cause of Gun Violence</h2>
      <p class="cause">Often overshadowed by misconceptions about the role of mental illness in gun violence, these actions are more often committed by those with risk factors, such as a past history of violence, and the overwhelming ease of access to the firearms themselves. In addition, the majority of gun violence is orchestrated by males even though most males are not perpetrators of gun violence. Those who fall through this gap are subject to the nuances of our society that often fosters this violence which can help to be prevented by behavioral threat assessments and community level prevention programs particularly for kids in at-risk environments.</p>
      <h2 class="communitiestitle">Impact on Communities of Color</h2>
      <p class="communities">Gun violence in America is usually committed in one of three categories, suicide, homicide, or mass shootings, the latter of which often garners the most news attention due to the fact that it’s often on larger scale. While homicides contribute to about 35% of annual gun deaths in the US, these acts of violence are more likely to impact communities of color particularly Black and Latinx communities. In fact, 60% of homicide victims were Black while Black Americans only make up 15% of the population.</p>
      <p class="communities">In these communities, nearly everyone is affected by gun violence from a young age. These experiences lead to many mental health consequences, such as PTSD and depression, and can also lead to an increased likelihood of violence, a prominent risk factor in future gun violence. These circumstances have created a cycle that in addition to social and economic inequalities have exacerbated these communities who often lack access to resources to prevent and treat these high instances of gun violence.</p>

      <h2 class="solutionstitle">Five Solutions to Prevent Gun Violence</h2>
      <ol>
        <li class="solutions"><b>Implement stronger, required background checks:</b> Despite a federal law requirement, background checks aren’t implemented on unlicensed gun dealers such as private individuals and online retailers leading to a high amount of guns purchased without screenings.</li>
        <li class="solutions"><b>Ban assault weapons:</b> The five deadliest mass shootings were committed with semi-automatic weapons made for war, not civil society.</li>
        <li class="solutions"><b>Increase the age limit to purchase all guns:</b> Although the age limit to purchase an assault weapon is 21 years, other guns can be purchased at 18 years old. In addition, minors can often access guns at home due to a lack of safe storage, all of which contributes to the almost 50% rate of youth suicides being committed with guns.</li>
        <li class="solutions"><b>Establish a federal waiting period:</b> Waiting periods for guns are more impactful on potential suicide committers as, research shows those who buy handguns are at a greater risk of taking their lives a week within purchase.</li>
        <li class="solutions"><b>Strengthening red flag laws nationally:</b> This is crucial as red flag laws allow anyone to petition for a court confiscation of a firearm for an individual who poses a threat to themselves or others. The significance of this is clear as states with the law implemented have stopped many potential mass shootings and suicides.</li>

      <h2 class="newlawtitle">New Gun Legislation</h2>
      <p class="newlaw">The most recent piece of gun legislation nationwide was signed in June 2022, sparked by the Buffalo, NY grocery store and Uvalde, TX school shootings that same year. The passing of the bipartisan bill strengthened background checks for young gun buyers, closed the “boyfriend gap” which keeps guns out of the hands of more domestic violence offenders, and helped states implement red flag laws. The bill also gave $13 billion to help strengthen mental health programs and schools, particularly those of former mass shootings.</p>
