<!-- Purpose/intro blurb -->
    <div>
      <p class="purpose">Minimize Mass Shootings was created by Semilola O as a project for the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program in June of 2022.</p>
      <p class="purpose">While she is passionate about many areas of social justice particularly racial equality, the plague of gun violence is something she has been focusing on for some time as well. This can be partly attributed to the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012, her first personal encounter with the realities of gun violence as she was a young CT elementary school student as well.</p>
      <p class="purpose">The opportunity to create this website gave Semilola a moment to create something to educate and inspire others and herself to learn more about the dynamic consequences of gun violence and minimize the numb reactions of American society to these tragic events.</p>
