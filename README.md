This project was created for the activist toolkit assignment as part of the 2022 June session of the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. 
For this assignment, I chose to focus on gun violence and gun control. This is a topic that I've been invested in for a while now, since freshman year. 
I've been drawn to the issue due to numerous experiences in my life and it's direct correlation with my identity. 
When I was younger, I remember the Sandy Hook shootings and they were quite impactful for me even at that age as I lived in CT at the time and was about
the same age as many of the kids.
In addition, as I've grown up I've realized the disproportianate impact of gun violence on those who share my identity - Black Americans. 
Over the years, these two factors have pulled me to spend extra moments learning and focusing on the impacts of gun violence something I am proud to 
be able to bring awarness to through this project.
